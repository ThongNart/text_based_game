#Finished: August 7, 2018
#Python 3.6.5
# Text game name: Mission Not Impossible
#Note on this game version 1.0
# to make this game I have sample lots of codes from James Gadoury and Francesco Balducci, and from Zed A Shaw too. Although I think that I modified them enough to be quit different from the original pieces.

# There are some still some imperfections to improve:
# 1- there are functions with are not necessary: like the choice for the gun, and the option to view show inventory (because without the other weapon choice - which will complicate the item part of the code, you don't need to choose the gun, and there is also nothing in the inventory to view - in the begining.)

# The game is quite linear (a linear story, not a dynamic story which can go in different directions), it forces the player to take the gun, to only have 1 enemy, which is super easy to kill - with 1 shot, to only pick 5 items and then the bomb goes off, the the player can't go back to the room and find another item.
 

#Technical limit of the game: the game doesn't let the player to drop the item he/she picks up and just let the player take the item randomly and can not change mind. And when the bomb starts, it's just luck that the player choose the right items to give clues to the player to guess the right password

#The intersting part is that the player can look into the clue from each item and figure out the lead for Mr. Anderson in next scene or to escape the boat and survive this round first.

# HOW TO PLAY?
#copy and paste the code in a text editor
#run it in a WindowPowershell like: python mission_not_impossible.py
